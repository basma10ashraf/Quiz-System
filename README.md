###PROJECT TITLE:
#Quiz system

###PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
#Quiz system is an exam form of MCQs in which,we have set 10 questions.
 For each right answer 1 mark will be increased and for each 
wrong answer nothing will be added to the total points 
and at the end of the quiz total marks will be shown.

For this aim we are using assembly language for 8086 microprocessor,
The simplest programming language for any CPU is assembly language.
A programmer can only use operations that are really implemented on
the physical CPU when using assembly language. Assembly language is
not portable across different processor families and lacks high-level 
conveniences like variables and functions. Assembly language is the most
potent programming language for computers, and it provides programmers
with the understanding they need to create efficient code in high-level languages.
Every serious programmer should make the time and effort to learn assembly language.

In order for the system to be used for academic purposes and to quickly and simply
measure student progress, we expect that in the future the user will be able to manually
add the needed questions.
